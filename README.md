# Portfolio

This is my portfolio template website. I am still very new at web development, so there is not much content in this site at the moment. The portfolio photos are placeholders.

Instructions were to design a responsive portfolio website using bootstrap to look like given example images.

This site will be updated as I create more projects and have more tools to showcase.

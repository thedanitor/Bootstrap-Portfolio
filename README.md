# Portfolio

## Description

Here is my portfolio. I am still new to web development, so there is not much to showcase yet. I am still learning and will be updating this site as my skill set grows.

https://thedanitor.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/

## Highlights

Since all I know at this point is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I thought I would highlight some of my skills by adding animations. Here is what it looks like when the page first loads.

There are more animations than that. Can you find them all?

Below the About section is the portfolio itself.

The footer of the page contains all the links to get in touch with me: email, github, linkedIn, and a pdf of my resume.

Using Bootstrap has greatly benefitted the responsiveness of the site, although it can be difficult to override some of the Bootstrap stylings.
